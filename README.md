# semantic-sec

A CLI tool that finds authorization and business-logic vulnerabilities (such as IDOR) in Laravel applications. It parses the project to build an authorization map of routes and the checks that protect them, picks candidate routes that lack an ownership check, and can optionally ask an LLM to confirm each one.

Status: under development.
